<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards.

Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

Hand Pallet Truck with Scale is an excellent economic solution for all weighing requirements in busy warehouse environments , which allows you to weigh cargo where you want and when you want. If any of the foregoing trucks is equipped with attachments, the rated capacity shall be expressed in pounds at a specified load center and for a specified load elevation.</p>
