Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable.

<p>When ascending or descending grades in excess of 10 percent, loaded trucks shall be driven with the load upgrade. Leveling Lift Kit: This is the most affordable kind of lift kit and is best for those who just want to look bigger on the road, because they only lift the front end and don't offer a significant enhancement to off-road trail performance.
