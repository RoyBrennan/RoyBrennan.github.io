<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6‚Äù suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>

One of the most important tests on a forklift is the American Society of Mechanical Engineers stability test.</p>
<p>Often one or more of these three types of reach trucks are used in warehouses. The result is a smarter, more scalable fleet of reach trucks. For 4-wheel internal combustion forklifts, options and accessories include mini-lever controls with an armrest that can be adjusted in three ways, an LPG swing-down bracket which can lower the bracket 65 degrees from the horizontal position, and a steering wheel knob that can make driving the lift more efficient.</p>

Our electric Yale forklifts are perfect for improving uptime in any warehouse. For me, the back glass and top of my truck can be pretty difficult to reach by hand unless (even without a lift kit). Accelerate your distribution and reduce unnecessary handling time with electric powered order picking equipment.</p>

Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that more than 540,000 forklift operators are employed across the country in all 50 states. Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling.</p>

Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
