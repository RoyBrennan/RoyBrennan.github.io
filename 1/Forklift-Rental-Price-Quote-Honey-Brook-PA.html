They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>This can be a time-consuming process, and our forklift purchasing guide tells you exactly where to start in choosing the right forklift. Motorized hand forklifts - These types of trucks can be operated both in stand-up or walking positions. NW Lift Truck Service wants your used, running and operating forklifts.

Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing.

Different mast types allow buyers to tailor machines more closely to applications frequently encountered. 216.1 (1) No person shall alter an industrial lift truck in such a way as to render ineffective a safety device installed on the truck, except where the alteration has been certified in writing by the manufacturer of the device or an engineer as affording protection equal to or greater than the protection afforded by the original device.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. Rentals often have service and repair costs built into that monthly payment. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components.</p>
