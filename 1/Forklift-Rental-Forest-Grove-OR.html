If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>

Choose machine category (petrol forklift, diesel, telescopic etc.), location, price range, manufacturer, production year and the seller, you want to buy the forklift from.
