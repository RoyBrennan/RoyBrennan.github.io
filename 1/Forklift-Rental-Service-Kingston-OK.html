KION Group is the other major material handling company in Germany, and they have even stronger sales than Jungheinrich. You've seen the big ol' monster trucks on TV, laying waste to everything they drive over.</p>
<p>The operator has to be aware of the forces bearing on the forklift as it turns corners. Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet. The SEAP and India Pallet Trucks market is estimated to expand at a significant CAGR in terms of value and volume over the forecast period.</p>
