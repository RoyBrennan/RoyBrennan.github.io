Regardless of the brand name, you should expect to find an engine capable of at least 74 to 78 hp on the lower end (straight mast forklifts) and up to 142 hp on the high end (encompassing telehandlers with extended reach capability).</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA.
