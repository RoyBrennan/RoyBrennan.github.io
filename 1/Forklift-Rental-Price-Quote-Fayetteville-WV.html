<p>Known for their durability and superior design, we are pleased to feature cushion and pneumatic tire trucks, and electric trucks in both 3-and 4-wheel designs. Reach trucks come in multiple forms, including the Stand-Up truck and Double-Deep truck. We teach forklift operators. Lift Code 4: Turret Trucks. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift. A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Your 4Ã—4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck.</p>

<p>Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator. Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines.
