<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. A heavy attachment lowers the amount of weight that the forklift can support. One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>
<p>Manufacturers have models of rough terrain forklifts with load capacities ranging from 4000 to 10000 lbs. When unloaded, the forklift's center of gravity is right about here.

Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor.
