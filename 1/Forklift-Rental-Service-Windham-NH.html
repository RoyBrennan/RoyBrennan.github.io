In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>

If you already have one of our electric forklift trucks, it can be easily retrofitted with lithium-ion power. They are also sometimes referred to as pallet trucks, pallet pumps, and pump trucks.</p>
<p>However, when you purchase a used forklift, operators will already be familiar with the forklift operations and can easily take over the job.

While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory.
