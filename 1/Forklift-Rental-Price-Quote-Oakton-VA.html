<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor” tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. Pallet jacks from Grainger provide leverage to help you lift heavy pallets full of inventory or materials in the warehouse, on the loading dock or at the jobsite.

Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>

Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
