<p>For the most part, trucks are made with body over frame” construction, which means that there is a basic metal frame for the truck and then the body of the truck is placed onto that frame and attached.

Counterbalanced and noncounterbalanced Fork Lift Trucks and Reach Trucks — The maximum weight; expressed in pounds, of a 48 inches homogeneous cube (24 inches load center) that a truck can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.</p>
