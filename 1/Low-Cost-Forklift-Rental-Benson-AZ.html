<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck.
