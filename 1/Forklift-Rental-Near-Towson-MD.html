Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts.

However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Straddle trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks and are used to carry long materials such as pipes, boards, and trees. To enable easy movement, the trucked equipped with 200 mm diameter, UHMW-PE steer wheels and UHMW-PE load rollers. The whole purpose of lifting a truck is to increase the size of tire that can be installed, especially since increasing tire size is the only true way of gaining ground clearance at the axle.</p>
