<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these wonderful machines or perhaps hoping to diversify your fleet, here are the seven different categories of forklifts and a breakdown of what they are used for. Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>

We highly recommend that you consult with us on which unit is best suited to your needs and that you discuss the best forklift rentals with our team to ensure that you streamline material handling processes within your business and keep related costs low at the same time.</p>
