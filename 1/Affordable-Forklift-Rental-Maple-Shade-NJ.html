<p>The weight of Best Value Pallet Truck, Pallet Jack 5500 lb. Capacity 27 x 48 is 159lbs. That give rise to the forklift trucks demand. At Frank Kent CDJR in Ennis, Texas, we are committed to not only providing the best trucks on the road but also the highest level of customer service possible.

<p>Based on region, the global pallet truck market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. That's very good for an electric forklift.

Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry.
