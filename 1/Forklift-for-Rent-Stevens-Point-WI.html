<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Lifted trucks have ample appealâ€”they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy. Ideal for narrow aisles the side stance truck has the forks located on the side of the cab affording excellent visibility for the operator and minimizing maneuvering. CLARK Material Handling Company is so proud of this patent that they even sell t-shirts with pictures of the patent claim.</p>
<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

<p>Well, one of the simplest ways to make a truck stand out is integrating a body lift kit or suspension lift kit. You can rent top-quality and expertly-maintained equipment at United Rentals. These are classifications of six commonly-used types of forklifts, as recognized by OSHA, along with different types of trucks unique to each class.

<p>With nine models to suit specific heavy duty applications, the H25-32XM series of all terrain forklifts provides high productivity, reliability, fuel efficiency and outstanding driver comfort to deliver an excellent return on investment. Another critical characteristic of the forklift is its instability. Choose the correct shock absorbers based on which end or ends of the vehicle you're working on.

This infographic looks at the rules and regulations concerning forklift safety, lays out important statistics, and provides tips for eliminating forklift hazards. In most cases, as soon as you make a serious modification such as lifting the vehicle, your truck's warranty is voided.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>But with lift kits, the danger is a little different. Towering over most other folks on the road also provides a greater view into the distance, which is a plus when driving on regular roads and when off-roading. Airide air bag suspension springs are manufactured by Firestone for heavy truck, trailer and bus for applications such as steering axle, seat, cab mount, drive axle, lift axle, and primary trailer air suspension.</p>
<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking. Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift. Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
