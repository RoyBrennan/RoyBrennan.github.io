	<meta name="description" content="Toyota Forklift Rental Around Waretown New Jersey - The electrically powered forklifts do not need any fuel and hence it is one of the most beneficial facts of it. As there is no need for fuel so the space required for fuel can be diminished as a result the forklift becomes smaller and hence small area is needed to keep it. It is not only cheaper to operate but also has a long life.">

<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>

Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure.

<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast.
