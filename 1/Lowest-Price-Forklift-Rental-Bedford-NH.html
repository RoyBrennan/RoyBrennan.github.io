<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard. But for serious off-road enthusiasts, getting a truck lifted or buying an existing lifted truck should certainly be a consideration at least. Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that there are no set rules for exactly how much a used forklift should price, and a whole lot will also depend on the demand and supply of used forklifts in your town.
