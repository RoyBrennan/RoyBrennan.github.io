When placed on the forks, the center of the test weight shall be located on the longitudinal centerline of the truck. This online course is meant for forklift operators, site safety engineers and managers in charge of following job site safety regulations.</p>

The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team.</p>
