Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Texas First Rentals San Antonio is a sister company of HOLT CAT®, the largest Caterpillar dealer in the United States. Body Lift Kit: If you're interested in getting more off-road capabilities but are still on a somewhat limited budget, go the middle ground with a body lift kit, which includes adding spacers between the body and frame to give you more space for off-road tires.</p>
