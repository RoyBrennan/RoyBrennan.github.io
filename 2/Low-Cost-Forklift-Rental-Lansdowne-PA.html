<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>

<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>If you need a forklift ASAP, renting may be for the way to go, as you can eliminate the hassle of third-party financing or credit requirements. Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort. The occurrence of a major rollover accident is increased because lifted trucks have beefier suspensions that require greater travel than a more modest truck or one that is not lifted at all.</p>
