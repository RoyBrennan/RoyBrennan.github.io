The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments.

<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
