<h2>What You Need To Know About Forklift Masts in Whitsett </h2>

We specialize in new and used warehouse forklifts to include narrow aisle reach trucks, pneumatic tire and cushion tire forklifts , order pickers and electric and manual pallet jacks.

<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
<p>This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side. Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well. We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>
<p>How to choose the right forklift for your business. The spacious cab and adjustable controls offer the operator great comfort, even at height. Driving a couple of inches higher won't only provide you with an improved view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris.

<h3>Forklift Training Systems Whitsett NC</h3>

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>Our dealers carry all major brands of forklifts to include Yale, Hyster, Crown, TCM, Raymond, Daewoo, CAT, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Clark, Toyota, Linde and Barrett. Linde has developed special design features that simplify the process of picking for every height - from the layout of the control platform and control panels, to the fold-out cab railings. The BT Levio W-series of powered pallet trucks consists of six truck models, including the compact LWE130 for more light-duty applications.</p>
<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts. Push the handle down to pump up the pallet jack, then let the handle come back using the mechanical spring. If you are interested in getting a lift installed or you just want to talk it over with a professional to know what you should do, feel free to come by and see what we can do. The road less traveled is out there waiting for you; let us help you find the perfect truck so you can tackle it.</p>
