Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>Order picking forklift truck means a forklift truck where the operator controls are incorporated with the lifting media and elevate with the lifting media. This heavy-duty multidirectional reach truck is AC driven with clear-view masts, 360Â° steering and sideways battery exchange for optimized productivity. For distributors who want to maximize their warehousing space through high density storage, a standup forklift offers significant advantages over a traditional sit-down truck.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
