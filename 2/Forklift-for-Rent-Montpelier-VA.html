<p>For loads exceeding 2500kg, a motorized pallet jack, "walkie stacker" or Forklift is recommended. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. Identify the maximum load weight you need to lift, and rent a forklift that could support such capacity. The Black Widow is a professionally lifted truck by SCA Performance.</p>

<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
