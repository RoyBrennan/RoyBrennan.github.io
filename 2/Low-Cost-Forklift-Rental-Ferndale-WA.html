<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Our order pickers are available in brands you can trust such as Unicarriers, EP Equipment and Xilin and are backed by 100% after sales service and support. The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>
