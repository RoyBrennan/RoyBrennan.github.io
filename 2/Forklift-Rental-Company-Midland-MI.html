One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks.

The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>

If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
