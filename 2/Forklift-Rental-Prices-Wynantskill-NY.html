A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>
