The lifting forks rise up to 31.5 inches, which saves the operator unnecessary bending and heavy lifting and increases efficiency in repetitive handling operations. Unlike standard forklifts, Agria are fitted with heavy duty pneumatic tyres, specifically designed for rough terrain operation.</p>
<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift. Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>

<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast. For intricate indoor operations, reach forklift trucks can provide drivers with another set of eyes when they are handling a robust inventory.</p>
<p>Our exclusive ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers industry-leading lift, lower and travel speeds and easy-to-use ergonomic controls enhance operator comfort for greater productivity. A lifted vehicle becomes naturally top heavy, which causes it to be sensitive while cornering and braking. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>

<p>Some of the conditions which may affect stability are, ground and floor conditions, grade, speed, loading (trucks equipped with attachments behave as partially loaded trucks even when operated without a load on the attachment), battery weight, dynamic and static forces, and the judgment exercised by the operator. The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team.</p>
