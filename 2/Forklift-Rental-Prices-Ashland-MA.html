Providing the best value in Linde forklift trucks available today, Granite Industrial Trucks, Inc.

Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism.
