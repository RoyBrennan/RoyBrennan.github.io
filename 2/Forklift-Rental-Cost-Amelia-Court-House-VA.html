Every Hyster and Yale forklift that you rent from Gregory Poole has been carefully examined and certified by our expert technicians to be in great condition.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is always the same: Every pallet truck from Linde should be able to be controlled effortlessly with only one hand.
