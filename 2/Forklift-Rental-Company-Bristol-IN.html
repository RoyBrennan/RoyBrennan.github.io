<h2>Importance of Forklift Training in Bristol </h2>
<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>The Raymond 7000 Series reach trucks are engineered for productivity in narrow aisle applications—handling small footprints and maximum throughput needs with over 200 configurations available. If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>
