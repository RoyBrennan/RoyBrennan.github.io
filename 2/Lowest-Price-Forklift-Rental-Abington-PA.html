<h2>Forklift Vs Stackers Abington </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to consider about how your truck will change after it's lifted. At Leson Chevrolet, we pride ourselves on being your lifted truck dealership in the Harvey and New Orleans area. We offer competitive pricing for both our short and long-term rentals and provide prompt delivery throughout the Mid-Atlantic region.
