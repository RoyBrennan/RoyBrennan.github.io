<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<h2>The Benefits Of An Electric Powered Forklift Bryan </h2>
<p>If your service crew is already busy with the rest of your equipment, don't load them up with even more equipment to maintain.
