The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet.

<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift. Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>
<p>Workers need to be trained in proper load management before operating this forklift. Before you can spice up your life with a lifted ride, you likely are in need of some financial help. Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load. If you are looking for a forklift dealer in northern and central Ohio, visit Mid-Ohio Forklifts. Before installing any attachment contact your local authorized dealer of your forklift brand and ask them to begin re-rating your lift according to the attachment you want to install.</p>
