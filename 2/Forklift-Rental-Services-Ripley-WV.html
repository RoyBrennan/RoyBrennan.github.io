<p>On the other hand, it's a more expensive method, while a body lift is a cheaper way to get a little more ride height and still improve your truck's off-roading abilities. You typically gain 1-3 inches of ground clearance with a suspension lift kit. Also referred to as a "warehouse forklift," this truck is designed to work indoors on flat ground. Due to the presence of the boom lift, this machine is considered a partially loaded truck even without a load on the attachment.</p>
<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
